# Bee Species Identification Project
### Project Overview
##### This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can distinguish between honey bees (Apis) and bumble bees (Bombus) from images. Given the importance of these pollinators in both ecology and agriculture, accurate identification of bee species can aid researchers in studying their behaviors, prevalence, and threats like colony collapse disorder.

#### Using various Python libraries and techniques, this project involves loading and preprocessing images, extracting features, and building a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to automatically detect bee species.
